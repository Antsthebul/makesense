Lexemes on Wikidata currently often lack their senses. For nouns we often also
have an item corresponding to the senses. This tools searches for such possible
senses for existing lexemes and adds them to a database. The flask based Webgui
then allows users to login with their Wikimedia account (using OAUTH) to decide
if an item really corresponds to a sense for the lexeme.

The tool is running on Toolforge:
